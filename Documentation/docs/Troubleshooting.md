# Issues and Troubleshooting

The following page includes some of the issues I have faced in using the ReJig program and some of the tips and troubleshooting advice for overcoming various difficulties. 

## The ReJig program freezes when running

This can be happen if you are running Gaussian/ORCA on the molecules you are wanting to ReJig. You may need to cancel your Gaussian jobs or allow them to finish before ReJig will continue. 

## Other Issues

This program is definitely a "work in progress". I have made it as easy to use as possible, but there are always oversights to program development and some parts of it may not be as easy to use as it could be. 

If you have any issues with the program or you think there would be better/easier ways to use and implement things in the ReJig program, write a message on the [ReJig Github Issues page](https://github.com/geoffreyweal/ReJig/issues). Feedback is very much welcome!
