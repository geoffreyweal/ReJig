## What is the ReJig Program

This program is designed to allow added or modified atoms in a crystal to relax about the molecule they are attached to.

## Installation

It is recommended to read the installation page before using the ReJig program. See [Installation: Setting Up ReJig and Pre-Requisites Packages](https://geoffreyweal.github.io/ReJig/Installation) for more information. Note that you can install ReJig through ``pip3`` and ``conda``. 

## Guide To Using ReJig

The ReJig program is one in a series of programs that are designed to be used in the workflow shown below. After you have installed ReJig, see [How To Use The ReJig Program](https://geoffreyweal.github.io/ReJig/Using_The_ReJig_Program) to learn about how to use this program. 

## The Grand Scheme

The ReJig program is used as part of a grand scheme for calculating the excited-state electronic properties of molecules in a crystal. This includes simulations of exciton and charge diffusion through crystal structures, in particular for organic molecules (but not limited to them). This scheme is shown below, along with where the ReJig program is used in this scheme.
